## 🚀 Current Status

Your app is now using **Web Speech API** automatically! Try clicking the microphone button - it should work without any credentials.

**Test it:**
1. Click the microphone button in your app
2. Allow microphone permissions if prompted
3. Speak normally - you should see transcription appearing

## 🔄 How the Fallback Works

The app automatically tries services in this order:
1. **Azure Speech** (if credentials provided)
2. **Web Speech API** (fallback - currently active)
3. Error message if nothing works

## 📝 Notes

- **Web Speech API** works great for most use cases

- All implementations use the same interface, so switching is seamless
